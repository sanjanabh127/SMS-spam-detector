# Machine_learning-5
The project applies different machine learning algorithms and compares their performance to highlight strengths and weaknesses in real-world text classification.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Handling â€“ Importing and preparing SMS text data

ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing â€“ Text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and feature extraction (Bag of Words, TF-IDF)

ðŸ¤– Model Training â€“ Applying multiple ML algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, etc.)

ðŸ“Š Evaluation â€“ Comparing models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

ðŸ“ˆ Visualization â€“ Performance metrics and comparison charts

This project is a hands-on demonstration of how different algorithms perform on a real-world NLP classification task.

##  Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Handling**  
   - Import and prepare SMS text data for analysis.  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Text cleaning (removing punctuation, lowercasing)  
   - Tokenization  
   - Stopword removal  
   - Feature extraction using **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF**  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Train multiple algorithms:  
     - Naive Bayes  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
     - Decision Tree  
     - Random Forest  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
     - And others  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Compare model performance using:  
     - Accuracy  
     - Precision  
     - Recall  
     - F1-score  
     - Confusion matrix  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Plot performance metrics and comparison charts for easy analysis
